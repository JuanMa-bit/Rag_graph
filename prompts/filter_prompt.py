Objective:

The goal is given a question and a set of entities, ranks the entities based on their importance to answer the question and returns the top 
ùëò
k entities in descending order of importance.

Instructions:

Input Parameters:

question (str): The question for which the entities need to be ranked.
entities (list of str): A list of entities that may be relevant to answering the question.
k (int): The number of top entities to return based on their importance.
Output:

A tuple of the top 
ùëò
k entities ordered from most important to least important.
Steps to Achieve the Objective:

Step 1: Preprocessing the Inputs:
Tokenize and preprocess the question to remove stopwords, punctuation, and to standardize the text (e.g., lowercasing).
Tokenize and preprocess each entity similarly.
Step 2: Entity Relevance Scoring:
Calculate the relevance score for each entity in relation to the question. 
Step 3: Ranking the Entities:
Rank the entities based on their relevance scores.
Select the top 
ùëò
k entities with the highest scores.
Step 4: Returning the Results:
Return the top 
ùëò
k entities as a tuple in descending order of importance.
